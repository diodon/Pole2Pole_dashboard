# P2P
Pole to Pole biodiversity explorer

This is a Rstudio Flexidashboard that produces a visualization of P2P biodiversity samplings

It is a work in progress and the data files are not public yet


Data Flow:

The P2P group agreed on two excel spreadsheets as a way of registering survey data from rockyshore and sandy beaches. The objective is to produce a set of files with DwC compliant field names and another set of files, with the same information, but in a format that facilitates the further analysis
